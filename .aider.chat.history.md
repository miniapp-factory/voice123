Technical Specification (TS) – Phantom Lens: Surreal Photo Explorer
1. Project Overview

Phantom Lens is a photo app where every snapshot is a portal to another dimension. Users capture, morph, and explore images that react to emotions, time, and randomness. Ordinary photography becomes surreal storytelling.

Purpose: Turn everyday photos into living, interactive art pieces that evolve unpredictably.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Capturing the Unseen

Take photos using the device camera.

Optional “mystery lens” mode: colors, shadows, and distortions change randomly.

Metadata includes emotion tag (happy, sad, eerie), timestamp, and “aura intensity” (AI-estimated mood).

2.2 Photo Morphing & Filters

Filters evolve dynamically based on:

Time of day

Weather

Nearby sounds or movement

Morphing options: liquid distortions, glitch echoes, dreamlike overlays.

AI-assisted surreal transformations: convert normal photo into something uncanny or abstract.

2.3 Photo Journals & Portals

Users create albums called “Portals”.

Photos in a portal react to each other: linking color schemes, moods, or themes.

Swipe through portals; photos animate slightly as if alive.

2.4 Search & Exploration

Search photos by:

Emotion aura

Dominant color

Filter type

Explore “random portals” created by other users (optional social feed).

2.5 Notifications & Surprises

“Photo whispers”: notifications when an old photo morphs overnight.

Daily prompts to capture an image matching a surreal theme.

2.6 Security & Privacy

Local storage for private portals.

Optional cloud sync with end-to-end encryption.

Permission management for camera, microphone, and location (for dynamic filters).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Platform: Mobile iOS & Android

Performance: Morphing and filter previews render <1s for 1080p photos.

UI: Surreal, interactive interface with animated transitions.

Storage: Efficient caching for morphing data; offline use.

4. Technical Stack

Mobile Framework: Flutter or React Native

Local DB: SQLite, Realm, or Hive for portal metadata

AI & Effects: TensorFlow Lite / Core ML for emotion and surreal transformations

Optional Cloud: Firebase or AWS for multi-device sync

5. Future Enhancements

AI-generated “dream worlds” from photo combinations.

Interactive AR mode: portals extend into 3D space.

NFT integration: mint surreal images as unique digital assets.

Social exploration: discover and remix other users’ portals.

Gamification: achievements for rare photo morphs, streaks, or moods captured.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
