+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS) – Phantom Lens: Surreal Photo Explorer
+1. Project Overview
+
+Phantom Lens is a photo app where every snapshot is a portal to another dimension. Users capture, morph, and explore images that react to emotions, time, and randomness. Ordinary photography becomes surreal storytelling.
+
+Purpose: Turn everyday photos into living, interactive art pieces that evolve unpredictably.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Capturing the Unseen
+
+Take photos using the device camera.
+
+Optional “mystery lens” mode: colors, shadows, and distortions change randomly.
+
+Metadata includes emotion tag (happy, sad, eerie), timestamp, and “aura intensity” (AI-estimated mood).
+
+2.2 Photo Morphing & Filters
+
+Filters evolve dynamically based on:
+
+Time of day
+
+Weather
+
+Nearby sounds or movement
+
+Morphing options: liquid distortions, glitch echoes, dreamlike overlays.
+
+AI-assisted surreal transformations: convert normal photo into something uncanny or abstract.
+
+2.3 Photo Journals & Portals
+
+Users create albums called “Portals”.
+
+Photos in a portal react to each other: linking color schemes, moods, or themes.
+
+Swipe through portals; photos animate slightly as if alive.
+
+2.4 Search & Exploration
+
+Search photos by:
+
+Emotion aura
+
+Dominant color
+
+Filter type
+
+Explore “random portals” created by other users (optional social feed).
+
+2.5 Notifications & Surprises
+
+“Photo whispers”: notifications when an old photo morphs overnight.
+
+Daily prompts to capture an image matching a surreal theme.
+
+2.6 Security & Privacy
+
+Local storage for private portals.
+
+Optional cloud sync with end-to-end encryption.
+
+Permission management for camera, microphone, and location (for dynamic filters).
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+
+Platform: Mobile iOS & Android
+
+Performance: Morphing and filter previews render <1s for 1080p photos.
+
+UI: Surreal, interactive interface with animated transitions.
+
+Storage: Efficient caching for morphing data; offline use.
+
+4. Technical Stack
+
+Mobile Framework: Flutter or React Native
+
+Local DB: SQLite, Realm, or Hive for portal metadata
+
+AI & Effects: TensorFlow Lite / Core ML for emotion and surreal transformations
+
+Optional Cloud: Firebase or AWS for multi-device sync
+
+5. Future Enhancements
+
+AI-generated “dream worlds” from photo combinations.
+
+Interactive AR mode: portals extend into 3D space.
+
+NFT integration: mint surreal images as unique digital assets.
+
+Social exploration: discover and remix other users’ portals.
+
+Gamification: achievements for rare photo morphs, streaks, or moods captured.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
